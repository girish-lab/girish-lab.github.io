Probabilistic Graphical Models refers to concise representations of probability distributions using graphs.
It also studies efficient algorithms for sampling distributions represented in such form. Sampling might need to be done from
the joint probability distribution, the marginals or even conditional distributions. Other algorithmic questions involve computing
the Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE), Maximum Aposteriori Estimate (MAP) etc. This topic has deep connections and applications to various
fields including Theoretical Computer Science, Machine Learning, Statistical Physics, Bioinformatics etc. We will also be covering analysis of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Algorithms.

Broadly the course will cover four modules

1. Representations
2. Inference
3. Learning
4. Advanced Topics (More on MCMC Methods, Normalizing Flows, Learning theory)

## Lectures

### Lec 1-2: Probability Recap
  - *Read:* For recalling basics of probability and graph theory, please go through [DB] Chapter 1, 2
  - *Solve:*
        - <sup>sub</sup> For any two distributions $p,q$ on $\\{1, \cdots, n \\}$, show that:
         $$\max\_{A \subseteq \\{1, \cdots, n\\}} | p(A) - q(A) | = \frac{\sum\_{i=1}^n | p(i) - q(i) |}{2}.$$
         Note that the event $A$ choosen in LHS is a way of distinguishing $p$ from $q$ using $1$ sample in the best possible way. The RHS is the $\ell_1$ norm $\|p - q\|_1$.
        - <sup>sub</sup> Prove that any DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) with finite number of vertices, has atleast one vertex with no incoming edges (ie. pointed towards it). Also show that there is atleast one vertex with no outgoing edges.

            [Hint] Note that there are infinite graphs where the statement is not true. Hence you need to use the fact that the graph has only finite number of nodes in the proof.
