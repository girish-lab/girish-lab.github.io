1. Implement a program, which
  1. Which on input the MN DAG (as adjacency matrix), and samples from the joint/and/or marginal distribution, learns the joint distribution.
  2. Which on input the MN DAG and the joint distribution, and a conditional probability query, outputs the probability
  The project should be made into a public github repo, with proper readme files.

- Bayes Ball
  1. Which on input X,Y,Z, checks conditional independence using d-seperation.
  All examples on the textbook need to be given as test cases.
  2. Linear Time Bayes Ball algorithm and analysis with latex scribe.

- Prove theorems regarding equivalence of Markov Networks. Equivalence of CI statement and d-seperability.
