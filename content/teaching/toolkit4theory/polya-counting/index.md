## Lecture 1  

Introduced the Counting under Symmetries Problem  
Group Theory  

### Read
- Chapters 3-6 in [TJ] (Mostly simple examples only. You may skip over familiar parts)

### Solve

- Let $H$ be a subgroup of $G$ which is a finite group. Consider the relation $R$ defined by $aRb$ if $ a - b \in H$. 
  - Show that $R$ is an equivalance relation.
  - Show that all equivalence classes under this relation has size $= |H|$.
