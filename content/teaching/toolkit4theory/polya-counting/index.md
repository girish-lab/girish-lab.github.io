### Read
- Chapters 3-6 in [TJ] (Mostly simple examples only. You may skip over familiar parts)

### Solve

- Let $H$ be a subgroup of $G$ which is a finite group. Consider the relation $R$ defined by $aRb$ if $ a - b \in H$. 
  - Show that $R$ is an equivalance relation.
  - Show that all equivalence classes under this relation has size $= |H|$.

### Solve

- A cyclic group is a group which is generated by a single element. Show that all subgroups of a cyclic group are also cyclic.
- Use the Polya Theorem covered in class to count the number of colorings with R,B of pie chart where each part has the same size with angle ($2\pi/n$). Note that rotating a pie chart about the center results in the same pie chart.
